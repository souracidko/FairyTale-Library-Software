# FairyTale-Library-Software
Thank you for choosing to use FLS. 
When we decided to make this FairyTale Library Software (FLS) we wanted it to be not just an another tool. 
Therefore we tried to make sure that using our software is both fun and elegant so that you will still want to use it even at the most stress full moment. 
FLS is power yet simple by design. 
It is advised for you to read this document before you start to use our software so you will get the best experience out of it. 
The document will provide you with the overview of what FLS is capable of and how to use it. 
This software is created for Fairytale Village University Collage to help them to manage their local library. 
FLS is capable of managing customers, items in the library like books, articles, CDs, DVDs, borrowing items, returning items, reserving items and warnings for returning 
the item or paying fine for not returning by the return date.
